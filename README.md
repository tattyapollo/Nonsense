A little matlab app that makes a square picture of random pixels
Not hard to use at all, it just takes the size you input and makes a square picture from it. 
The picture will be in the same directory as the program.
The max size i have found was 18749, idk if its a matlab limit or a png limit, it was meraly a GB though.
Usually small picture are more interesting to look at but Im not gonna tell you what to do.
